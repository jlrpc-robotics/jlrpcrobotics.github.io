          <p>Third year of uni meant doing the micromouse competition. This competition, inspired by the worldwide Micro-mouse events, asked us to develop a small autonomous robot capable of completing a obstacle course comprised of 16x16 
          mazes, a winding causeway and a spiral ramp. To do this, I used IR sensors, due to their ease of use and the difference in color between the </p>

          <p>The microcontroller required for this project was a <a href="https://os.mbed.com/platforms/ST-Nucleo-L432KC/">Nucleo L432KC</a>, a type of small STM32 board. Similar to the Face Robot, low-level C was required here.</p>

          <p><i>2024</i></p>
          <p>In my second year of uni, I worked on a small robotics project for one of my classes. The goal of this project was to develop a life-sized face robot that could realistically display a few emotions through preprogrammed animations.</p>
          <p>As such, we were required to have eyes that moved at least from side-to-side, a mouth that could open and close as well as eyebrows. These elements allowed the robot to display the required emotional animations for the rubric.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we were allowed to develop an X-factor, an custom element that would aid the realism of the face robot. Notably for this, we were allowed to use derivative designs. 
            For this, I chose to employ <a href="https://willcogley.notion.site/?p=fee129fa32a443749f88524f53702f5a&pm=c">Will Cogley's EyeMech Design.</a> Unlike the bare-minimum required design, this mechanism allowd for up-and-down movement as well,
            which meant that the eyes could move in any direction, just like a real human.
            For the Jaw, I used a single MG90s servo motor inside the bearing-suspended jaw to rotate it.
            Two more MG90s servo motors controlled the popsicle-stick eyebrows. Together, these elements gave a suprisingly realistic face movements.</p>
            <p>To control the robot, there were two modes. The first mode allowed the user to control the robot through a set of buttons that would display specific facial movements (happy/sad/surprised). The second mode cycled through the different emotions until 
            its internal microphone heard a volume above a certain threshold, where it would display a suprised emotion for a few seconds before going back to cycling through the different emotions.</p>
            <p>The Mega 2560 R3 microcontroller was programmed in low-level Arduino, and no libraries were allowed for submission.</p>
